        <p><strong>The modernized visualization of John Snow's 1854 Cholera Map was created by Demi Johnson for Dr. Khairi Reda's, 
         Fall 2020, H517: Visualization Design, Analysis, and Evaluation course conducted at IUPUI. The goal of this project is 
         to recreate the original map in an interactive version and create additional charts by using today's tools of trade
          (D3, Data-Driven Documents). </strong><br/><p>

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>At the start of this project, I knew I was going to be incredibly challenged. I have never used anything like D3, 
            let alone very much JavaScript or HTML. To begin the project, my first step in the design process was to gain a 
            solid understanding of the data, which I was going to be creating the visualizations from. Additionally, it was great
             to have the original map from John Snow as a reference while creating my map. I decided from the files given,
              that I wanted to create three other maps to represent the deaths by date, by gender and by age group. 
        <h4>Initial Designs:</h4>
        <p>My initial design involved the street map to the left of the other corresponding charts. The timeline chart, another bar
             chart to show the number of deaths by gender and a bar chart to show the number of deaths by age group would be those 
             corresponding charts to the right. Also, I wanted an about section at the top underneath the page title, and buttons 
             for my additional links underneath the charts and maps. After implementing this initial design, I began to see that I
              should modify the layout to make it easier for the user to see all charts at one time and to allow the map zoom to be more
               accessible. Therefore, I moved the buttons under the about section at the top of the page and aligned the three 
               corresponding charts above the map. I centered the map and added map instructions underneath so users can understand 
               how to zoom in and out, and hover over the data points.</p>

        <h3>Rationale for Design Choices</h3>
        <h4>Colors</h4>
        <p>When choosing my colors, I wanted to select symbolic and stereotypical colors for my maps and charts. 
            I also wanted to pick colors that will be visible for those users that are color blind or have 
            color impaired vision. I used the color blindness simulator, Color Oracle to test if the colors
             I chose would be sufficient with “Deuteranopia”, “Protanopia”, and “Tritanopia” color vision. 
             Color Oracle is a color tool recommended by Dr. Reda.</p>
        <a href="http://colororacle.org/">Color Oracle</a>
        <ul>
        <li>Pumps = Large, blue circles; to represent water and to be easily visible in comparison to the deaths 
        </li>
         <li>Deaths = Small, red circles; to represent death
        </li>
        <li>Streets = dark grey; good contrast between the white background but not too dark to allow the street names to be visible
        </li>
        <li>Street names = Small, bold, black color : easier to notice but does not hinder the data variables
        </li>
        <li>Timeline chart = Red line chart; the chart also represents death
        </li>
        <li>Gender chart: 
            Female bar = pink; in color psychology we typically align pink with girl //
            Male bar = blue; with color psychology we align blue with boy           
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Chart Arrangement</h4>
        <p>As mentioned in my design process above, I arranged my charts the way I did to allow easy
             visibility and accessibility. I wanted this to be a priority in my design so users can 
             make easy correlations between the map and charts.</p>
        <p>Why bar and line charts?
        <ul>
        <li>The two additional charts I made bar charts because they are easy to visualize comparing 
            grouped data and when comparing two different groups against each other. If I were able 
            to figure out how, I would have created these bar charts into pie charts. That is because
             the data could be broken up into percentages, being perfect for a pie chart.
        </li>
        <li>I chose a line chart for my Timeline visualization so you can make a quick assumption on
             when the peaks were. Also, because line charts are good when wanting to show data over 
             a period of time.
        </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Facts and Findings</h3>
        <p>With the creation of my three additional charts that collectively manipulated the map, I could make a 
        few new discoveries regarding the data that John Snow’s original map made it difficult to conclude:
        <ul>
        <li>The youth and elders were affected most by Cholera, an anticipated relational discovery to disease.
             Age ranges 0-10 and 80+ had the highest number of deaths.
        </li>
        <li>A huge spike in deaths around September 1st and 2nd, was the Broad Street water pump excessively used 
            a few days prior? 
        </li>
        <li>There were no gender biases with the deaths from Cholera, the number of deaths were relatively similar.
        </li>
        <li>On the map it showed some ‘outliers’ you could say when it comes to locations of deaths. Did 
            those people work near the pump? Many had other pumps near by them. What caused them to use the 
            Broad Street pump? 
        </li>
        </p>
